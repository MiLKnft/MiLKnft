# MiLK DAO 
MiLK DAO is a democratic and autonomous organization on Cardano. The DAO's purposes are to use the pooled funds to invest in NFTs, Tokens and "Infrastructure" to create value for the DAO on blockchains including Cardano but not limited to it.

## Treasury Wallet
The treasury wallet will receive 70% of the mint funds, while the team will receive 30%.
The treasury wallet will also receive 80% of the royalties received from secondary market MiLK DAO sales, while the team will receive 20%.

The treasury wallet will be public and linked here and on Discord for everyone to follow.

- 29/10/2022 22:00 UTC The public mint starts, everyone is able to purchase an unlimited amount of MiLK DAO NFTs, up to 5 per tx for 200 ADA each.

The total supply of MiLK DAO NFTs is capped at 10,000.

## Voting and $MOO
### In order to bring the best on-chain voting experience MiLK DAO has partenered with Voteaire and will be using their tools.

At first voting power will be given to MiLK DAO NFTs where 1 MILK DAO NFT = 1 vote, when $MOO tokens are introduced the voting power will be taken from the MiLK DAO NFTs and given to the tokens where 1 $MOO = 1 vote.

- $MOO has a fixed supply of 100,000,000.
- First portion of $MOO airdropped to holders of MiLK DAO NFTs in December 2022.
- $MOO holders will be able to stake their tokens to receive $MOO rewards, staking can be improved by holding MiLK DAO NFTs.

### $MOO distribution

 - 50,000,000 (50%) $MOO in staking rewards.
 - 25,000,000 (25%) $MOO in MiLK DAO's treasury.
 - 15,000,000 (15%) $MOO Airdropped to the MiLK DAO NFTs holders.
 - 10,000,000 (10%) $MOO Airdropped to the team.

### $MOO airdrops

Holding MiLK DAO NFT will grant the holders 1,500 $MOO airdropped in 2 instances.
First airdrop happening on December 2022, airdropping 1,005 $MOO (67% of total airdrop) per MiLK DAO NFT.
Second airdrop happening on December 2023, airdropping 495 $MOO (33% of total airdrop) per MiLK DAO NFT.

Team members will be airdropped at the same time and the same percentages of total airdrop as holders.

### $MOO staking

Holders will be able to stake their $MOO, the staking APY can be improved if the stakers also hold MiLK DAO NFTs.
Staking APY can be improved further by upgrading the MiLK DAO NFTs at the cost of burning some $MOO.


## "Infrastructure"
One of the things making MiLK DAO different is that other than generating value only from buying and selling assets, MiLK DAO is also allocating a portion of its funds to help the ecosystem grow.

Some examples of funding "Infrastructure" :
- Funding a new or existing youtube channel
- Funding a new or existing twitter space
- Funding a new or existing dAPP

These fundings are usually single investments that will constantly generate growth and value to the DAO and the Cardano ecosystem.

*The amount of funds allocated for infrastructure is to be decided by the DAO*
